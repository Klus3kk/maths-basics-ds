# ðŸŽ“ Foundations of Mathematics in Data Science
Welcome! This repository is based on the book "Essential Math for Data Science" by Thomas Nield. If you're eager to explore how mathematics underpins the world of data science, you've come to the right place! 

I will avoid some topics because some of them are pretty much the basics of what you should already know.

## Prerequisites
You'll need Python 3 installed on your system, along with some common data science libraries:
```
pip install numpy scipy sympy scikit-learn
```
You should be already familiar with programming in Python, but it isn't necessary
## Chapters
The repository is divided into six chapters, with the inclusion of the code examples:
* The Basics of Maths
* Probability
* Statistics
* Linear Algebra
* Regressions
* Neural Networks
## Contributions
If you have improvements, ideas, or find any errors, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Contributions are always welcome!
