# âˆ« Integrals

An integral represents the area under a curve defined by a function. The integral of a function \( f(x) \) from \( a \) to \( b \) is written as:

\[
\int_a^b f(x) \, dx
\]

### Example

Find the integral of \( f(x) = x^2 \) from 0 to 2:

\[
\int_0^2 x^2 \, dx = \left[ \frac{x^3}{3} \right]_0^2 = \frac{2^3}{3} - \frac{0^3}{3} = \frac{8}{3}
\]

### Fundamental Theorem of Calculus

The derivative of the integral of a function gives back the original function:

\[
\frac{d}{dx} \left( \int_a^x f(t) \, dt \right) = f(x)
\]
