# ðŸ”— Chain Rule

The Chain Rule is used to differentiate composite functions. If you have a function \( y = f(g(x)) \), the derivative of \( y \) with respect to \( x \) is:

\[ \frac{dy}{dx} = f'(g(x)) \cdot g'(x) \]

### Example

Let's differentiate the function \( y = \sin(3x^2) \).

1. Identify the outer function \( f(u) = \sin(u) \) and the inner function \( g(x) = 3x^2 \).
2. Differentiate the outer function: \( f'(u) = \cos(u) \).
3. Differentiate the inner function: \( g'(x) = 6x \).
4. Apply the Chain Rule:

\[
\frac{dy}{dx} = \cos(3x^2) \cdot 6x
\]

So, the derivative of \( y = \sin(3x^2) \) with respect to \( x \) is \( \cos(3x^2) \cdot 6x \).
