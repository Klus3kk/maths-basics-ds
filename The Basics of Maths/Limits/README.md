# ➗ Limits

A limit describes the value that a function approaches as the input approaches some value. It's written as:

\[
\lim_{{x \to c}} f(x)
\]

### Example

Evaluate \( \lim_{{x \to 2}} (3x + 1) \):

\[
\lim_{{x \to 2}} (3x + 1) = 3(2) + 1 = 7
\]

### Indeterminate Forms

Sometimes limits result in forms like \( \frac{0}{0} \), requiring techniques like L'Hôpital's Rule to resolve.

### Example

Evaluate \( \lim_{{x \to 0}} \frac{\sin(x)}{x} \):

\[
\lim_{{x \to 0}} \frac{\sin(x)}{x} = 1
\]

# Derivatives

A derivative represents the rate of change of a function with respect to a variable. If \( f(x) \) is a function, its derivative is written as \( f'(x) \) or \( \frac{df}{dx} \).

### Example

Differentiate \( f(x) = x^2 \):

\[
f'(x) = 2x
\]

# Partial Derivatives

Partial derivatives are used when dealing with functions of multiple variables. The partial derivative of \( f(x, y) \) with respect to \( x \) is written as \( \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} \).

### Example

Find the partial derivative of \( f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 \) with respect to \( x \):

\[
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = 2x
\]
