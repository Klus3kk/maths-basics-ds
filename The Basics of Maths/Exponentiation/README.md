# ðŸš€ Exponentiation

Exponentiation refers to raising a number (the base) to the power of an exponent. It's written as \( a^b \), where \( a \) is the base and \( b \) is the exponent.

### Example

Calculate \( 2^3 \):

\[
2^3 = 2 \times 2 \times 2 = 8
\]

### Properties

1. **Multiplication of Powers**: \( a^m \times a^n = a^{m+n} \)
2. **Power of a Power**: \( (a^m)^n = a^{m \times n} \)
3. **Division of Powers**: \( \frac{a^m}{a^n} = a^{m-n} \)

### Example

Simplify \( \frac{2^5}{2^2} \):

\[
\frac{2^5}{2^2} = 2^{5-2} = 2^3 = 8
\]
