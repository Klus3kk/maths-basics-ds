# âž• Summing

Summation is the process of adding a sequence of numbers, often expressed using the sigma notation \( \Sigma \).

### Example

Calculate the sum of the first 5 positive integers:

\[
\sum_{{i=1}}^{5} i = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15
\]

### Arithmetic Series

The sum of an arithmetic series is given by:

\[
S_n = \frac{n}{2} (a_1 + a_n)
\]

Where \( n \) is the number of terms, \( a_1 \) is the first term, and \( a_n \) is the last term.

### Example

Sum the first 100 positive integers:

\[
S_{100} = \frac{100}{2} (1 + 100) = 50 \times 101 = 5050
\]
