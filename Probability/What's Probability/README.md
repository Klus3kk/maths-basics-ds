# ðŸŽ² What's Probability?

Probability is a measure of the likelihood that a particular event will occur. It's expressed as a number between 0 and 1, where 0 indicates impossibility and 1 indicates certainty.

### Example

The probability of flipping a fair coin and getting heads is:

\[
P(\text{Heads}) = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of outcomes}} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

## Probability vs Statistics

- **Probability** is the theoretical study of random events. It deals with predicting the likelihood of future events.
- **Statistics** involves analyzing the frequency of past events to infer probabilities.

### Example

If you roll a die 100 times and get a "3" 18 times, statistics tell you that the empirical probability is \( \frac{18}{100} = 0.18 \), but the theoretical probability is \( \frac{1}{6} \approx 0.167 \).

## Probability to Chance

Probability is often referred to as "chance" in everyday language. For instance, saying there's a "50% chance of rain" means there's a 0.5 probability that it will rain.

### Example

If a lottery has a 1 in 1,000,000 chance of winning, the probability of winning is:

\[
P(\text{Win}) = \frac{1}{1,000,000} = 0.000001
\]
